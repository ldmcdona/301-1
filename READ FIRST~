This is my assignment 1 submission for CMPUT 301.

I recieved assistance from Logan Yue who helped me learn and understand more about android studio and about java as a language. 

Additionally, aspects of code structure were learned from stack-overflow and borrow variable names from those sources. 

Currently the app will take multiple subscriptions and display their name, date, and cost in the listview on the main page. Clicking on a subscription in the listview will take you to the Edit page which is will display the name, date, and comment, but not the cost. While you can edit the display boxs with new values the Edit page is mostly just a placeholder, and both buttons just dump you back to the main screen without doing anything.  

Git was giving me some trouble, so I have included the apk file in the folder labeled "apk".
